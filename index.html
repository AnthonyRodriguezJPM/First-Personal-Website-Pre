        <p id="p1">Zoe is a 6 month old German Sheppard. It has been about 3 weeks since our family adopted her. She is very energetic, a walk alone will not be sufficient to keep her active lifestyle busy. She is a 
          working dog that requires alot of stimulation. She is receiving plenty of training to re-direct her energy towards positive tasks.
          We love her very much, and is now a new member of the family!</p>
